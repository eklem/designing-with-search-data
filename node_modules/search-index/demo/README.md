# search-index browser demo

Plain JavaScript exammple. Just some simple stuff to listen to button clicks, getting content from form and doing populating HTML when doing a search.

* `search-index.js` - A sym-link to the latest search-index.js in the `dist` folder, giving you the library through the global variable `searchIndex`.
* `search-app.js` - The actual search app.
* `index.html` - A minimal web page with form fields for adding content and searching.
* `*.css` - Some CSS to make it look okay in all browsers (also on mobile phones).
