# Designing with search data
Plugin for Adobe XD - A search engine running inside XD to easily populate your search application design.

## Concept
Easily access the different results of a search query to populate the design. No more faking autosuggests for partial queries.

Check out the blogpost "[Designing with search data](https://knowitlabs.no/designing-with-search-data-5c8b6b6d3fa1)".

![A mockup of the design in use](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*IHo4akTFtxOMqhkYsTS6VQ.png)

The actual application will be a bit different, but concept will be the same. [Check out a video of how it could work](https://youtu.be/A-rr1h-sjYw).
